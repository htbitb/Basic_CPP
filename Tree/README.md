## Tree
**Functionality**: A hierarchical data structure made up of nodes, where each node has a parent and possibly children. Special cases include:

* **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.

* **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater.

**Why We Need Them**: Trees allow hierarchical data representation and enable efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

**Use Case**: Used in databases (B-trees), file systems, autocomplete systems (Trie), and representing hierarchical data (organizational charts).

**Real-Life Application**: Caching in Web Browsers

* **Use Case**: Web browsers use hash tables to cache web pages. Each URL is the key, and the corresponding page content is the value. This allows browsers to quickly retrieve cached pages, significantly improving browsing speed.
