## Stacks
**Functionality**: Follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Operations include push(), pop(), and peek().

**Why We Need Them**: Useful for maintaining function calls (recursion), undo mechanisms, or parsing expressions.

**Use Case**: Used in algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), parsing parentheses, and managing browser history.

**Real-Life Application**: 
* Undo Feature in Text Editors
  * **Use Case**: Text editors such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs use stacks to manage the undo and redo functionalities. Each action you perform is pushed onto a stack, and hitting "undo" pops the last action off the stack to revert it.

* Expression Evaluation (Calculator)

    * **Use Case**: Calculators use stacks to evaluate mathematical expressions. When you enter a complex expression, the system converts it into a postfix notation using a stack and evaluates it efficiently.

## Queues
**Functionality**: Follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Basic operations include enqueue() and dequeue().

**Why We Need Them**: Useful for scheduling processes, buffering, and handling asynchronous data.

**Use Case**: Implementing breadth-first search (BFS), printer task scheduling, or handling real-time streaming data.

**Real-Life Application**: 
* Call Center Systems
    * Use Case: In call centers, customers waiting in line for an available agent are managed using queues. First, customers are enqueued (added to the end), and when an agent becomes available, the first customer in the queue is dequeued (served).

* Ticketing Systems
    * **Use Case**: In ticket booking systems (e.g., for concerts or flights), customers are placed in a queue, and tickets are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.
