## Linked Lists
* **Functionality**: A series of nodes, where each node points to the next one. Can be singly or doubly linked.
* **Why We Need Them**: They allow efficient insertions and deletions as compared to arrays.
* **Use Case**: Useful for dynamic memory allocation, undo functionality in applications, or representing a queue (FIFO) or stack (LIFO).
